# Security Policy

Study-Studio is a Tauri desktop application (part of the
Hatemshalaby15071979 production-readiness set). It is pre-production software
and has not passed an independent security review. The desktop build pulls a
sidecar from the separate private `Helix-Education` repository at a pinned
release; treat that dependency as part of the trusted build boundary.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| `main` (default branch) | Yes — pre-production; treat as unstable |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Use GitHub Security > Report a vulnerability** (private advisory). Do not open a
public issue containing exploit details, and do not include real learner data,
credentials, or personal data in any report.

Until a maintainer acknowledges the advisory, please also avoid discussing
specifics in public channels.

## Response times

- Acknowledgement: within 7 days of a private advisory being opened.
- Triage / first update: within 14 days.
- These are best-effort targets for a pre-production, single-maintainer project.

## Scope

In scope: vulnerabilities in this repository's code and released artifacts,
including the desktop packaging path.
Out of scope: the `Helix-Education` sidecar (report via that repository),
dependencies (report upstream), and any local-only or archived clones not
published to this repository.
